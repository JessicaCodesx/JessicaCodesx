# Hi there, I'm Jessica!

I'm a **senior Computer Science student** in my final year of an Honours Bachelor's program.  
I love building **fun, creative, and meaningful projects** that blend learning with practical applications.  
Whether it's a study helper app, a casino game for friends, or a full-stack booking system â€” I enjoy turning ideas into code.
