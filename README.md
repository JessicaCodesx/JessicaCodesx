# Hi there, I'm Jessica!

🎓 I'm a **senior Computer Science student** in my final year of an Honours Bachelor's program.  
💻 I love building **fun, creative, and meaningful projects** that blend learning with practical applications.  
🎯 Whether it's a study helper app, a casino game for friends, or a full-stack booking system — I enjoy turning ideas into code.
